# EventLst

This is an events app. It will aggregate events from other sources and index in them in a useful and informative format.

It is built using an Asp.net Web-Api service layer which connects a Single Page AngularJS app to the data.

The entire project is built using Test Driven Development for both C# and Javascript. The SPA uses Lineman.js which is a wrapper for grunt build tasks.
